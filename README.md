# brute-forcer


### What is this?
This is a project made by me for my high school's math maker faire that took place in February 2022. This project is coded completly in Java on Replit. 

### What does it do?


### How does it do?


### How can this be improved for the future? 
These ideas are also written at the top of the main.java file in a comment.
 - make the time calculation more accurate
    (have it take in data from the previous runs + blank run, and then average the ratio)
 - make the brute forcing blind to the length of code
 - have the unknown character check only print each character once
    (right now it prints all instances, not each character (ex: "^, &, ^, ^" vs: "^, &")
